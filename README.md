   - Projects will be revealed upon clicking this section
   - Example projects:
     - Sales Performance Dashboard
     - Financial Analysis Models
     - Data Cleaning and Transformation

2. **SQL Projects**

## Code Implementation Examples

### Scroll-Triggered Animation
```javascript
// Using Intersection Observer for scroll animations
const animatedElements = document.querySelectorAll('.animate-on-scroll');

const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      entry.target.classList.add('animated');
      observer.unobserve(entry.target);
    }
  });
}, {
  threshold: 0.15
});

animatedElements.forEach(element => {
  observer.observe(element);
});
```

### Smooth Navbar Transition
```javascript
// Transparent to solid navbar on scroll
const navbar = document.querySelector('.navbar');
window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  if (window.scrollY > 50) {
    navbar.classList.add('scrolled');
  } else {
    navbar.classList.remove('scrolled');
  }
});
```

### GSAP Animation Example
```javascript
// Hero section animation with GSAP
gsap.from('.hero-title', {
  duration: 1.2,
  y: 50,
  opacity: 0,
  ease: 'power3.out',
  stagger: 0.2
});

gsap.from('.hero-subtitle', {
  duration: 1,
  y: 30,
  opacity: 0,
  ease: 'power3.out',
  delay: 0.8
});

gsap.from('.hero-cta', {
  duration: 0.8,
  scale: 0.8,
  opacity: 0,
  ease: 'back.out(1.7)',
  delay: 1.2
});
```

## Performance Benchmarks
